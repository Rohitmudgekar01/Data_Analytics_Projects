In Data Analytics, I have worked on two projects. First  one is e-Commerce project ie Olist Store Analysis.
In this we received 9 different datasets. Firstly I analyzed the data and worked on cleaning the data using Power Query Editor. 
Then merged all the files by establishing relation between them thus creating a master data.
Then understood the problem statements and created new columns according to that.
Using this data created some KPIs according to the requirement and then created dashboard using filters, slicers, table calculations etc in MS Excel, Power BI and Tableau and also created queries to obtain the same output.
